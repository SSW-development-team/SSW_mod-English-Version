 ITA_nannbusigenn:0 "Expand southern mining of resources"
 ITA_hokubusanngyou_desc:0 "Today, large Italian companies are operating in the north of the country. We should support the construction of their private factories and the expansion of consumer goods."
 ITA_nannbusanngyou_desc:0 "In Italy, industrialization is stagnating in the south as large companies are concentrated in the north. Let's increase the number of factories and industrialization in the south to gain an equal position on the peninsula."
 ITA_kougyoukibannnokakuritu_desc:0 "The industrial base is now well established in both the north and the south. The expansion of these private industries has made Italy highly developed. The technological know-how of the industry's expansion will also help to further modernize the technology. Integration and management of these would allow for the development of the military industry."
 ITA_autoraada_desc:0 "The Autostrada was extended to 400 kilometers in total around 1930, but with the end of the war and the industrialization of the South, further demand was created. It is also available as a source of finance and infrastructure for military operations, so the further extension of this and more lanes should be promoted as the main infrastructure project."
 ITA_tityuukaishotou_desc:0 "The Mediterranean Islands, gained by victory in the Great War, are only used as a recreational area for some high-ranking officers. The islands could be put to good use by offering them to the civilian population."
 ITA_minnkannkoujou_desc:0 "The development of the Mediterranean Islands has made the land sufficient for the industry. It will increase employment and quell discontent among the residents of the archipelago, allowing them to work with the community."
 ITA_kuretazousennjo_desc:0 "Crete's location in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and its proximity to the Suez Canal and other key locations make it an economic and military use for the island by promoting the naval industry. As a first step, Crete's shipbuilding industry should be promoted."
 ITA_gunnjitekikaihatu_desc:0 "The Mediterranean Islands are no longer an important industrial zone for Italy. It is militarily viable and should be developed militarily for use as a local supply point."
 ITA_minnkannsanngyou_desc:0 "Now that the Mediterranean islands have been successfully developed and the industry has been extended in many areas, there are still chronic employment problems. Further development should be carried out to relieve the discontent of the local people."
 ITA_shokuminntikaihatu_desc:0 "The North African region holds no longer colonial interests as its infrastructure was destroyed by the combat of the latest war. There are also fears of an active pro-independence movement in that region. We should support the development of infrastructure to rebuild and make it vital for our economic use."
 ITA_sekiyukaihatu_desc:0 "In a world where mobile warfare tactics are established, oil is an indispensable resource for operating cars and tanks. Fortunately, there are vast reserves of oil in our Libyan colonies. We should develop these reserves and use them for military and industrial purposes as soon as possible."
 ITA_toripori_desc:0 "With the rebuilding of North Africa's infrastructure and the development of its oil resources, Tripoli is one of the most developed regions in North Africa. It will be necessary to build more factories here to increase the efficiency of transportation."
 ITA_kitaafurikatetudou_desc:0 "Our country, which controls the Suez Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar, encompasses a maritime transport network in the Mediterranean Sea. Trade delegations transiting this region operate only in the Mediterranean and European regions. Consequently, goods from African colonies cannot be delivered directly to the home nation. To solve this problem, the idea of building highways in the North African region to facilitate logistics is beginning to spread in the Italian industry world. That should be understood and efforts should be made to further develop the home nation."
 ITA_shokuminntisinnshutu_desc:0 "Corporations, which have owned a huge power through payments of the Latest-War, and industrial support for North and South, are more interested in the benefits of low-wage labour on the colonies than on the Italian peninsula, where employment is already close to the limit."
 ITA_ribiaheiki_desc:0 "The colony, developed by corporate and industrial support, could ultimately work to produce weapons. Those Libyan-made weapons would be a valuable source of production, along with industry in the homeland."
 ITA_etiopiakaihatu_desc:0 "The East African region, which was obtained during the Second Ethiopian War and combined with the surrounding former Allied colonies, is still reeling from the legacy of the war and its infrastructure is in a state of decimation. Let's try to improve the region's infrastructure by developing the Ethiopian region, which has experienced a relatively little damage."
 ITA_higasiafurika5_desc:0 "Now that we have successfully developed East Africa, we should adopt a five-year plan that has achieved a lot of benefits and push ahead with heavy industries in order to achieve total industrialization of the region."
 ITA_juuminntonokyouryoku_desc:0 "In the midst of industrialization and development in the East African region, conflicts with indigenous peoples are intensifying. If this confusion can be calmed down and the people understood, both the colonies and the home countries can develop."
 ITA_zousennjinokakutyou_desc:0 "The Second World War has reaffirmed that our navy is poor. But having held the keystone of the Mediterranean, we must first of all increase the size of our shipyards in order to make this absolute dominance more unassailable."
 ITA_darumatia_desc:0 "Dalmatia, which borders the Adriatic Sea, has taught us that this region is good for shipbuilding. We should make the most of this opportunity."
 ITA_minnkannzousennjo_desc:0 "Now that it has been determined that further expansion of the present shipyard would be useful in expanding the Italian Navy, this could be accomplished by the acquisition of a private shipyard."
 ITA_itariasikinozousenn_desc:0 "With the successful expansion of the shipyards and the formation of a large navy, the adoption of Italy's own shipbuilding technology will be a symbol of the high level of our industry."
 ITA_itariasanngyoushou_desc:0 "Today, the Italian government announced the creation of the Italian Ministry of Industry, which will oversee Italy's industry and factory production. The public has high hopes for the new agency and there will be a lively debate over the funding gap and dealing with the North-South issue."
 ITA_seisannkourituka_desc:0 "The study found that the current production of a variety of equipment at the same time and in the same factory is reducing the efficiency of production per factory. Small arms, which are mainly capable of mass production, will benefit from this as the Italian Ministry of Industry organizes the production details of the factories."
 ITA_armyreform:0 "Military reform"
 ITA_armyreform_desc:0 "It is an undeniable fact that the Italian Army is weak. In order to improve it, we must invest a generous amount of money and time in tackling the problem."
 ITA_maneuveringstrategy:0 "maneuvering strategy"
 ITA_maneuveringstrategy_desc:0 "Mobile warfare is a new strategy invented by the Germans in the last war. Our country, which has gained industrial power, which is its only drawback, should adopt this strategy."
 ITA_artillerydrivenstrategy:0 "Artillery-led strategy"
 ITA_artillerydrivenstrategy_desc:0 "World War II has made the usefulness of tanks an absolute necessity. However, even such tanks would be no match for artillery firepower."

 ITA_supporttankresearch:0 "Support to tank companies"
 ITA_supporttankresearch_desc:0 "We realized that as we moved forward with our tank research, we didn't quite understand the risks of suddenly trying new technology. We outsourced this to a company with a proven track record in tank research and efficient tank research."

 ITA_itariayonnkanenn_desc:0 "The Italian Ministry of Industry today announced the Italian Four-Year Plan for Italy.

 ITA_yutakanaitaria_desc:0 "With the help of various reforms and support, people's lives are steadily getting richer. Let's use this economic margin for building more factories."
 ITA_sikinnkakusanozesei_desc:0 "As the country grows richer, the regional wage gap continues to create friction, and now that friction is becoming serious social unrest. Before the problem gets worse, wages in different regions should be examined and action is taken to ensure that the funds are spread as equally as possible."
 ITA_makenuke_desc:0 "The nuclear bombs, whose existence was confirmed at the end of The Second World War, terrorized the world. These developments will be necessary for our country to gain an edge."
