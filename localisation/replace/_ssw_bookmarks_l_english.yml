 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Wailing World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The second world war that mankind experienced transformed the world map more than any other in history. While Japan, Germany and Italy won the war and established their own strong spheres of influence, the defeated United States and the Soviet Union disintegrated and divided, and the British and French lost the prestige of their former colonial empires altogether. Seven years have passed since the end of the disastrous world war. The world, which enjoyed a brief respite of peace, is about to move again. We humans will never be able to eradicate war from the earth, but the future when war will eradicate humanity may not be so far away..."
 SSW_JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After their successful victories in both the Sino-Japanese and Pacific wars, Japan succeeded in taking over almost all of East Asia and the Pacific islands. After the war, party politics was restored, and the army and navy were ostracized by the public. The army and navy became alienated from the public. It aimed to further expand its power to the new continent via the Pacific, and its support for the American Civil Liberties Union was part of this effort. We must fight again to keep the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere alive and to bring about a new world order."
